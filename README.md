This minimod changes markets and submarkets work.

1. Weapons and combat ships are scarce and highly regulated. As such, only Military Markets sell weapons, LPCs, and combat ships. Open Markets and Black Markets still sell civilian grade ships, albeit of inferior quality.
1. Factions are armed to the teeth. Any non-hidden market has at least an orbiting station and patrol fleet.
