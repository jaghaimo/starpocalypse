    ## MILITARY REGULATIONS AND CONTRABAND
    # Buying or selling marines, weapons, LPCs, or combat ships on Open Market is illegal unless you are commissioned
    # with the owner of the market. Uses same logic as Military market with the exception of:
    # 1. Lower stability will cause some illegal items to become legal, and
    # 2. Blacklist can be applied to make item or ship always legal.
