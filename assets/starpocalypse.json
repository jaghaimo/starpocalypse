    ## MILITARY REGULATIONS
    # Buying or selling military wares Open Market is illegal unless you are commissioned with the owner of the market.
    # Uses same logic as Military market with the addition of:
    # - Legal list is applied to make item or ship always legal,
    # - All civ-grade or civ-hint ships are always legal.
