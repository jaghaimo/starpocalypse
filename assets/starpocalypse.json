    ## UTILITY MOD - READ THIS BEFORE ENABLING!
    # Traditionally, Starpocalypse has been a utility mod, meaning you can disable the mod at will without breaking
    # your save. Unfortunately, the new implementation requires additional API methods to be added in order to correctly
    # persist progress while still being a utility mod. As such, I have decided to temporarily BREAK the utility
    # aspect of the mod. To enable utility aspect of the mod, set below to true. The consequence of playing with
    # `isUtility` enabled is:
    # 1. Suspicion level will reset each time you save. Trade on black market and get suspicion level to say `extreme`,
    #    leave the market, save the game, dock and notice suspicion level dropping to `none`.
    # 2. Delayed reputation change due to legal or illegal trade will not happen if you save too early after the trade.
    # This option will be removed (and mod becomes a true utility mod again) once new API calls are released.
    # For details see: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=23826
    "isUtility": false,

    ## D-MODS FOR ALL
    # Damage pristine ships that the player can buy.
    "addDmodsToShipsInSubmarkets": true,
    # Damage pristine ships in player's starting fleet.
    "addDmodsToStartingFleet": true,
    # Configure min and max of d-mods each pristine ship should receive. Ships with less d-mods are ignored.
    # Used by both options above. Minimum is always at least 1, and maximum at most 5.
    "minimumDmods": 2,
    "maximumDmods": 4,

    ## MILITARY REGULATIONS
    # Buying or selling military wares Open Market is illegal unless you are commissioned with the owner of the market.
    # Uses same logic as Military market with the addition of:
    # - Legal list is applied to make item or ship always legal,
    # - All civ-grade or civ-hint ships are always legal.
    "militaryRegulations": true,
    # Suspicion level will grow even with transponder off. It is still useful to sell illegal wares.
    "transparentMarket": true,
    # Setting this to 0 essentially disabled the feature. Setting this to 1 makes it behave as if the transponder was on
    # for suspicion calculations. Setting it above 1 will cause a penalty for trading with transponder off.
    "transparentMarketMult": 0.5,
    # Accessing black market is only possible with transponder turned off.
    "shyBlackMarket": false,

    ## BETTER MARKET DEFENCES
    # Adds a tier 1 station to all non-hidden markets that do not have a station.
    "addStations": true,
    # Add extra structures to eligible markets (Ground Defenses to all markets and Patrol HQ to core markets).
    "addGroundDefenses": true,
    "addPatrolHqs": true,

    ## REPUTATION CHANGES
    # After winning an engagement, the enemies of the beaten fleet will have a slightly better reputation of you.
    # Their allies will dislike you slightly more, though.
    "combatAdjustedReputation": true,
    # Raiding for special items instantly ruins player reputation with the owner of the item.
    "hostilityForSpecialItemRaid": true,
